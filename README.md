SMSS application in java to send messages

A Simple Message Sequence Specification (SMSS) editor allows a modeler to describe one method of a class by capturing the messages sent from one object to another. Each message has a name and is sent from a sender object to a receiver object. Each object is typed by its class. There is only one sender object in an SMSS, and its type is the class of the method described by the SMSS. The name of the sender object may be specified. 

It is also possible to define alternative and parallel fragments that can be placed before or after any message in an SMSS. Each fragment has two or more operands. Each operand exists of one or more messages. In an alternative fragment, each operand has a condition. 
The parameters including return parameters of the described method and messages are out of scope for this exercise. Nested fragments are also out of scope.
